## What Is It?

This project is a Color Computer 3 emulator written in C. Note that I cannot 
distribute ROM files with the emulator, as they are copyright their 
respective owners.

The Color Computer 3 is the third incarnation of the Tandy Radio Shack 
Color Computer line (TRS-80). The CoCo 3 offered several improvements 
over the original CoCo 1 and CoCo 2, most notably the introduction of 
a memory management unit (MMU) and a new Advanced Color Video Chip 
(ACVC) - also known as the Graphics Interrupt Memory Enhancer (GIME).

While the official name of the computer was the TRS-80 Color Computer 
3, the Color Computer family was quite different from the line of 
business machines such as the TRS-80 Model I, II, III, and 4. While 
that family of computers used a Zilog Z80 microprocessor, the Color 
Computer family used a Motorola 6809E processor running at 0.89 MHz.
